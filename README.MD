Extend / Open Source
Good things should be free, and open source. You can fork this project on github or contribute to the code, request features, post issues or even setup your own search engine like this by ripping this site off, I won't mind, the more the merrier. To install it on your server, you just need to grab a copy from github and unzip it to your php host. Then change some things in the "customize" folder (like logos, social buttons,analytics) and you are done. You can also email me
