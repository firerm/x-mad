<h1>Welcome to the x-mad search engine</h1> 

<p><a href="http://x-mad.com">x-mad.com</a> is  just another magnet/torrents search engine under development. x-mad is a one man project that was built initially to automate certain procedures that a downloader does every day like visiting torrent web sites, searching for top seeds, searching for new movies to watch, get ideas for music etc. Everything has been bundled into one easy interface. </p>
<p>A search using the search bar above will bring up only top seeded magnet links taken from various sources. Clicking on the top Movies,Music and similar buttons will pull from reliable sources the top movies, top music and more. Nothing is hosted on this website. Whenever you click a button a sophisticated minimal php crawler will spider the web for the thing you are looking for and return the results in a nice jquery enviroment</p>

<h2>Technologies used</h2>

<p>php and jquery has been used to make this website. Elements of the layout and the css are from a template found on the <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/freebies/web-page-templates/free-xhtml-template-pack-luxury-classic/" target="_blank">sixrevisions</a> website.</p>
<p>There is no database in this website, except a txt file that holds the recent searches that can be found on the right bar</p>

<h2>Extend / Open Source</h2>

<p>Good things should be free, and open source. You can <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad" target="_blank">fork this project on github</a> or contribute to the code, <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad/issues" target="_blank">request features, post issues</a> or even setup your own search engine like this by ripping this site off, I won't mind, the more the merrier. To install it on your server, you just need to <a href="https://github.com/upggr/x-mad/zipball/master">grab a copy</a> from github and unzip it to your php host. Then change some things in the &quot;customize&quot; folder (like logos, social buttons,analytics) and you are done. You can also <a href="mailto:info@x-mad.com">email</a> me </p>
